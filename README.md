[RenArtDB (Renaissance Art Database)](url) is a learning resource for the study of Renaissance art and came together as a collaborative project within the context of the module 'Renaissance Art and Architecture' (Spring Term 2016) thanks to the collaboration and active participation of [undergraduate students](url team) from both Art History and Psychology at the [University of Buckingham](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/humanities/arthistory).

RenArtDB makes information on Renaissance art easily accessible and reusable through an interactive [map](https://carlocorsato.carto.com/viz/206c5c72-66fb-11e6-8585-0e3ff518bd15/public_map) and a machine-readable [dataset](https://github.com/carlocorsato/RenArtDB/blob/master/RenArt_DB_Dataset_1.0.csv). Consisting of a selection of over 130 paintings and sculptures located in both Europe and North America, the dataset allows you to view key descriptive meta data of each artwork, including both original and current locations. 

The dataset is provided as a spreadsheet in .csv format and can be dowloaded clicking on Clone/Download and then Download Zip. To open/edit the dateset we recommend [Libreoffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) or [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/), as they offer more flexibility with the parsing. Otherwise, Ms Excel or Numbers for Mac are also suitable for the purpose.
