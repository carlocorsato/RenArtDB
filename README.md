Renaissance Art Database (RenArtDB) is a visual learning resource for the stydy of Renaissance art. 

Whether you are a student, an art lover or a professional, you may visually access over 130 Renaissance paintings and sculptors through an interactive Map displaying both current and original locations. If you wish to edit, implement or fully reuse any information, you are welcome to contact us, download our data set and share your up-to-date version. 

RenArtDB came together as a collaborative project within the context of the module 'Renaissance Art and Architecture' (Spring Term 2016). 

Under the supervision of Carlo Corsato a Team of 12 undergraduate students from both Art History and Psychology at the University of Buckingham filled information on the data set, shared a spreadsheet on Google Drive and used a Facebook group to discuss and fix any issues they came across.
